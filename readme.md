# Rust and Copilot Samples

Welcome to the Rust and Copilot Samples repository! This project is designed to help you learn Rust through a series of fun and engaging examples. We've included a few visual algorithms to make the learning process even more enjoyable.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

## Running the Samples

Once you have Rust installed, you can run the samples using the following command:

```sh
cargo run --help
