# Rust and Copilot Samples

Welcome to the Rust and Copilot Samples repository! This project is designed to help me/you learn Rust through a series of fun and engaging examples. I've included a few visual algorithms using piston (Rust crate running on Windows) to make the learning process even more enjoyable (I play a lot with the parameter to enjoy funny animation).

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

## Running the Samples

Once you have Rust installed and cloned this repo, you can run the samples by navigating to the project folder and using the following command as a start:

```sh
cargo run
cargo run help
